Dear Reader,

this programm is just starting to become a real nice tool to look at,
if you have any question belonging the OS/2 PM. I call it Benchmark
programm because it will check some kind of performance, but the idea
is to write a programm which touches every part of the PM as simple
as possible. Because this programm is only 10 hours old, only the
a few GPI-Calls are implemented.

But to get YOUR comments as soon as possible, i've uploaded this
double plus pre alpha beta gamma version 0.00001a, you know.

I'll work on this little very private every weekend. An update will
come weekly at PCM:PROGRAMMING, CIS:ZENITH, and others.

Everything include in this small packing is my very own stuff,
released for the public domain.

Hope to get lots of comments.

Yours for now

Axel Salomon

PS.:

This is the second version with some Dialog and Menu functions included.
When you select "All" within one of the "Win"-Menus the following 
problems are known :

- MIA_CHECKED donït work
- Everythings left on the screen until the test is ended
